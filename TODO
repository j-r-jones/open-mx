* try get_user_pages_fast() with 32pages chunks or so

* how to tune mtu/packet-ring-size since 8k-mediums do not always help?

* update all thresholds in non-wire-compat
  + make them configurable?
  + merge small/tiny and change the packet type in the driver to TINY
    only in wire-compat mode?

* make omx_prepare_binding more flexible:
  + work on a single board, with --append or --clearfile
  + pass a modulo, or even a hash function
  + pass a irq-name/pattern
* add a tool to auto-tune the interface coalescing and binding?
  + do it within the startup script?

* regcache
  + disable regcache in omx_rcache_test when the driver feature flag is missing
* regcache malloc hook (if no driver feature flag)
* if killed while registering, needed to mark the region as failed?
* huge page pinning support
  + add a pagesize in the region segment structure and use either pagesize of hugepagesize when possible
* if failing to deregister region
  *** glibc detected *** tests/omx_pingpong: malloc(): memory corruption: 0x000000000064edd0 ***

* group similar fields in structure for cache effects, cache-align some fields?
  + add a counter per list and group them as well to reduce the progression loop overhead

* add warning about mtu in nic/switches when truncated packet arrives, with printk_rate

=== obsolete ideas
* why shared memory from/to same send and recv buffer is very bad from 64k+ 128k ?
* change --iface into ---iface, and use --iface as a "close when no more endpoint"
* make NEED_SEQNUM a resource and use DELAYED for throttling as well ?
* what's in src_generation ? unset/unchecked in OMX
* wire-compat at runtime (8kB frame needs 17bits for medium length)
* req->recv.specific.medium.frags_received_mask and .accumulated_length are redundant
  + the mask is needed to detect duplicates, and the length prevents from precomputing the missing mask
* make shared comms runtime-configurable in the driver
* use mediumva for shared medium? seems slower
  + and mediums are not that useful for shared anyway (lower rndv threshold)
* fix make install -j
  + just support make -j followed by make install -j, otherwise it's a useless mess
