* add warning about mtu in nic/switches when truncated packet arrives, with printk_rate

=== obsolete ideas
* why shared memory from/to same send and recv buffer is very bad from 64k+ 128k ?
* change --iface into ---iface, and use --iface as a "close when no more endpoint"
* make NEED_SEQNUM a resource and use DELAYED for throttling as well ?
* what's in src_generation ? unset/unchecked in OMX
* wire-compat at runtime (8kB frame needs 17bits for medium length)
* req->recv.specific.medium.frags_received_mask and .accumulated_length are redundant
  + the mask is needed to detect duplicates, and the length prevents from precomputing the missing mask
* make shared comms runtime-configurable in the driver
