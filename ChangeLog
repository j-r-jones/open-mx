Open-MX 1.1.1 (August 3rd 2009, svn r2693)
==========================================
The multirail release.

Bug fixes:
* Change the reverse peer index table into a per-interface table to
  prevent messages from being delivered to the wrong boards in some
  multirail configurations.
* Add the OMX_CONNECT_POLLALL environment variable to enforce polling
  on all endpoints while waiting for a connect request to complete,
  work around for connection deadlocks in multirail configurations.
* Change some globals to endpoint-specific variables so that multiple 
  endpoints within a single endpoint actually get their progression.
* Fix the management of local peers when clearing the peer table.
* Fix completion of requests in case of timeout.
* Fix destroying of incomplete large send requests.
* Fix management of return and status codes in the MX ABI compatibility
  wrappers.
* Improve sanity checks for notify messages so as to prevent buggy
  duplicate completion of large send requests.
* Fix the periodical checking of the driver status in the library.
* Fix MTU reporting in the driver status.
* A couple other minor improvements.

Caveats:
* No background progression or retransmission is done if the application
  does not invoke an Open-MX routine explicitly.

* Add shared communication between endpoints on the same nodes, even if
  they are attached to different interfaces.

  calling mx_disconnect() or when detecting new sessions.
* Enable sleeping functions by default when using blocking calls since
  they now take care of waking up for progression if necessary.
